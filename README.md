# Melanoma Classification ðŸ”¬
A model based on EfficientNet-B7 to classify melanoma (a type of skin cancer) from skin images. In this project, I build a model based on EfficientNet-B7 to classify skin images as either being "Melanoma" or "Healthy". I use PyTorch XLA, EfficientNet PyTorch, and Albumentations to train the model using data from the SIIM-ISIC Melanoma Classification competition on Kaggle.
